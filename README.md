## Description
Tempest is an adhd management/game tool. Why can games and distractions be so dangerous for people with ADHD? They are at high risk to login, stay plugged in, and have a hard time escaping dopamine loops. With ADHD when you push the power button on the game to turn it off, your are also turning off your value and sense of self.  Tempest is a way to gamify the real world and your health so when you log out of the 'game' you still have a healthy life because of it.

  The app offers customized profile login.  When first using the app you are provided with a survey to tailor your experience and health toward growth. Instead of treating adhd like an illness or abnormal it helps you embrace who you are, pull out the unmanageable weeds, and thrive in a the garden of life.  

  The basic version of the app includes basic tools that are proven to help those with ADHD, tracks usage of the tools, and provides instant feedback to your character/avatar.
